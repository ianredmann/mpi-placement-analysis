# Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Math Placement Index (MPI)

This repository documents my **Math Scholarship Senior Project**, which evaluated the effectiveness of Ouachita Baptist University’s **Math Placement Index (MPI)** system in placing incoming students into appropriate first-year mathematics courses.

The project combined **statistical data analysis**, institutional policy evaluation, and outcome-based success metrics to assess whether current placement methods align with student performance.

## 📊 Project Overview

The **Math Placement Index (MPI)** is used by the OBU Mathematics Department to determine a student’s initial math course placement. Correct placement is critical, as it strongly influences student success, confidence, and retention in mathematics.

**MPI Formula:**

\[
\text{MPI} = \left( \frac{\text{ACT Math}}{36} + \frac{\text{High School GPA}}{4.0} \right) \times 50
\]

- If a student **does not have an ACT score**, they may take a **25-question placement exam**
- The placement exam replaces the ACT score using the conversion:

\[
\text{ACT Equivalent} = \text{Placement Exam Score} + 10
\]

## ✅ Definition of Success

Student placement was considered **successful** if:

- **≥ 80%** of students earned a **C or higher (A/B/C)**  
- *(OBU also tracks a 50% A/B benchmark, but the primary focus of this analysis was the 80% ABC threshold)*

This standard reflects whether students were placed into courses aligned with their preparation level.

## 🧠 Research Focus

The overall project was divided into multiple research groups, each analyzing different aspects of MPI effectiveness.

### **My Group’s Focus**
**Evaluating the effectiveness of the placement exam as a substitute for ACT scores**

Specifically, we asked:
- Does the placement exam accurately replicate ACT-based placement outcomes?
- Do students placed using the exam meet the same success benchmarks as ACT-placed students?
- Is the placement exam reliable for borderline placement decisions?

---

## 🔍 Methodology

- Analyzed historical student placement and grade outcome data
- Compared success rates across MPI ranges and course cutoffs
- Evaluated placement exam outcomes against ACT/SAT-based placements
- Measured success using the 80% ABC standard
- Identified cutoff ranges where misplacement risk was highest

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- **Overall placement exam success rate:** **79.29%**
- MPI is generally effective at placing students correctly, especially in higher-level courses
- There is no sufficient data to come to a reasonable conclusion on the effectiveness of the placement exam due to high variability
- Students placed using ACT/SAT data tended to show slightly more consistent outcomes in borderline cases

---

## 📌 Conclusions & Recommendations

- MPI improves overall math placement accuracy
- Most courses meet or exceed the 80% success standard
- Some mid-level courses would benefit from adjusted cutoff scores
- **Recommendation:**  
  Use **ACT/SAT scores when available**, especially for borderline placements, and reserve the placement exam for cases where standardized test data is unavailable
